# Bearing Fault Detection using Unsupervised Machine Learning

Bearing fault is the major source of majority mechanical faults. For example, over 41% induction motor failures are caused by Bearing failure.[[source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S095741581400004X#:~:text=The%20simplest%20frequency%2Ddomain%20analysis,generated%20by%20simultaneously%2Dactive%20equipment)] 


The simplest frequency-domain analysis method used for bearing fault detection is Fast-Fourier-Transform (FFT). The impact of vibration generated by a bearing fault has relatively low energy and it is often accompanied by high energy noise and vibration generated by simultaneously-active equipment. Therefore, it is difficult to identify the bearing fault in the spectra using conventional FFT methods.

To overcome FFT problems, unsupervised Machine Learning can be a powerful tooling to detect the vital difference of the virbaition spectrum induced by bearing fault. In this post, I will focus on the unsupervised machine learning for bearing fault detections. The machine learning algorthms covered in this post are PCA, kernal-PCA, t-SNE and Autoencoders. We will first talk about the data used in this study.
